### Goal ###

The app was designed following the [Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVC)

The goal is to detect motion in a sequence of static images (video frames). This is accomplished by comparing two in a row, first resizing them to 500 pixels of width, then graying them, after that, create a new image with the absolute difference of between the two images. At last, with this new image use a dilated 
binary threshold and find the contours. If the area of any contour is bigger than the threshold chosen, there is motion.

### Design ###

The app uses an Object Oriented approach and was designed following the [Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/MVC)
